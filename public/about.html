<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Aidan! Born in Austin, Texas. Did my undergrad in physics where I was introduced to python, the numpy library, and the abililty to
  display graphs and do matrix manipulation with arrays! I quickly moved to Denver where I worked with an IOT access control company using
  a rails based app. I have also gained a basic understanding of rust while assisting an open source hardware/software startup in the HVAC space!
</p>

<p>In my time at the IOT company, I gained domain knowledge on thier hardwired access solution, as well as taught myself SQL querying to analyse and report
  data inconsistancies leading to bug identification and resolution! Their app was on the rails framework, react frontend, and overall microservice architecture. 
  The business was access control management, so lots of IOT API integration accross different IOT companies and devices. They also hosted their own customer API. 
  This called for many relational databases needed to capture native data and cross relate to the core databases.
